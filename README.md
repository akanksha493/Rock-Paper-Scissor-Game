# Rock Paper Scissor Game
A javascript project based on traditional [rock paper scissor game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). This project is part of [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) Curriculum.

### How Does It Work?
Just like the original Rock-Paper-Scissor there are only three rules:

1. Rock beats Scissor.
2. Scissor beats Paper.
3. and Paper beats Rocks.

And that it. Thats how it works. Give it a try.
